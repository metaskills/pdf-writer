= PDF::Writer for Ruby
This library provides the ability to create PDF documents using only native
Ruby libraries. There are several demo programs available in the demo/
directory. The canonical documentation for PDF::Writer is "manual.pdf", which
can be generated using bin/techbook (just "techbook" for RubyGem users) and
the manual file "manual.pwd".

This software is based on Adobe's PDF Reference, Fifth Edition, version 1.6.
This and earlier editions are available from Adobe's PDF developer
website[http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/pdf/index_reference.html].

== Ruby 2.0 Compatibility
This gem version has been updated to work with Ruby 2.0.  This is a maintenance
effort only to support moving existing projects from Ruby 1.8 to 2.0.  New project
development should use Prawn[1] over PDF-Writer as it is actively maintained and 
is also the successor/rewrite of this library.

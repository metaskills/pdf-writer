PDF::Writer requires both Transaction::Simple 1.3.0 or later and color-tools
1.3.0 or later.

Transaction::Simple:: http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=295
color-tools::         http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=81

Once these packages are installed, PDF::Writer can be installed with:

  % ruby setup.rb

Alternatively, you can use the RubyGems version of PDF::Writer available as
pdf-writer-1.1.3.gem from the usual sources. The gem knows its dependencies
on Transaction::Simple and color-tools and offers to install them.

If you are using the RubyGems version of PDF::Writer, it is recommended that
you download the demo programs from the RubyForge site for PDF::Writer.
